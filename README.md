# 100 Days of Code – Python Bootcamp

This repository contains my daily code and projects from **"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu**.

The goal of this challenge is simple: **code consistently, build real projects, and become confident using Python in practical scenarios**.
